# exercism-solutions
All of my exercism.io public solutions!
- Uses the [Exercism](https://exercism.io) CLI to download and submit projects

## Running the Exercism CLI
- __Running `./setup.sh` will *not* add exercism to your PATH.__

If you're using the [Gitpod workspace](https://www.gitpod.io#https://github.com/carterisonline/exercism-solutions-rs) or another temporary workspace solution:
- Make sure you've provided Gitpod with your Excercism Key. Run `gp env EXERCISM_KEY=xxxxx` if you haven't already.
- Run `source setup.sh` to run the script in your own shell process, and add `$GITPOD_REPO_ROOT/programs` to the PATH. __Running this command multiple times *will* add `./programs` to your path multiple times.__ Not intended for personal workspaces.
